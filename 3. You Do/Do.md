# You Do

Create a `boolean` array with a length of `5`.

Use a regular `for` loop and a `Scanner` object (Unit 6 Section 1 Part 4 Understanding Check) to have the user fill in the 5 boolean values in that array.

Use an enhanced `for` loop to calculate the percentage of `boolean` values that are `true`.

When first run, the output should look like this:

```
Please enter a boolean: 
```

Once completed, here is a sample of what the output could look like:

```
Please enter a boolean: false
Please enter a boolean: true
Please enter a boolean: true
Please enter a boolean: false
Please enter a boolean: false
40.0% of the boolean values are true
```

It should be able to handle from 0.0% to 100.0%, so try a variety of inputs to ensure it is working correctly. The percentage should be formatted as shown in the example.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
