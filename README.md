# Developing Algorithms Using Arrays

With arrays and the ability to traverse them in different ways, we can look at a variety of common problems and solutions that arrays are a part of.

This section covers the following material:

- Two Types of Problems
- Question-Answer Algorithms
    - Minimum/Maximum Value
    - Sum
    - Average
    - Mode
    - An Element with a Property
    - All Elements with a Property
    - Access All Consecutive Pairs of Elements
    - Determine the Presence or Absence of Duplicate Elements
    - Determine the Number of Elements Meeting Criteria
- Array Modification Algorithms
    - Shift Elements Left/Right
    - Reverse the Order of Elements
