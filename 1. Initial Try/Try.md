# Initial Try

In the `Try.java` file, there is a section of code that is supposed to produce the following output:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

Can you fix the enhanced `for` loop header and the print statement to properly produce this output?

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
