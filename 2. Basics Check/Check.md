# Basics Check

In `Check.java`, you will find a completed version of the random numbers practice from Unit 6 Section 2 Part 3 - You Do. With our new understanding of enhanced `for` loops, see if you can improve this code.

Focus only on the `assignRandomValues` and `smoothValues` methods, can/should those loops be changed to enhance `for` loops?

**Did you change the assignRandomValues method?** (Answer Here)

**If you did change the assignRandomValues method, what did you change?** (Answer Here)

**If you did not change the assignRandomValues method, why not?** (Answer Here)

**Did you change the smoothValues method?** (Answer Here)

**If you did change the smoothValues method, what did you change?** (Answer Here)

**If you did not change the smoothValues method, why not?** (Answer Here)

If you made any changes to the program, verify that it is working correctly by running it several times and checking the output.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
